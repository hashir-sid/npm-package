# index file description

# The asyncOperation function returns a promise and simulates an asynchronous operation using setTimeout.

# The promises are chained using .then() to ensure sequential execution.

# If any promise in the chain is rejected (an error occurs), it jumps to the nearest .catch() block for error handling.
